Recently I had chance to touch some startups on data solution in US. That is a very good oppotunity to learn and understand the cutting-edge technologies on next generation of data solution. Here I note the impression about them. 
 
 1. there are many small but innovative startups in US, but saw few such kinds of startups in China but too many
 2. in-memory computation and real-time computation are the trend. big data is not only big volume, but also fast
 3. spark is a foundamental of NG data framework since its ecosystem is so big and the community is growing so fast
 4. good documentation and UI management tool are a plus that can help developers to understand the system and reduce potential risk as possible
 5. customers are first. (ondemand)
 6. work very hard even for those who are very seniors
